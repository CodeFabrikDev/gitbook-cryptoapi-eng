# \[GET] /deposit/list

The \[GET] /deposit/list method returns a list of all deposit addresses generated for each blockchain network associated with the userâ€™s account. It provides a centralized view of public addresses, allowing users to easily see which addresses specific to each network (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) they can receive deposits to. This functionality is useful for platforms that manage multiple cryptocurrencies and want to make it easier to track active addresses, ensuring that transactions are sent to the correct locations on the blockchain network.

### Authorization

```
Bearer <Your API token>
```
