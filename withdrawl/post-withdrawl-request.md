# \[POST] /withdrawl/request

The \[POST] /withdrawl/request method allows you to request a cryptocurrency withdrawal, requiring additional confirmation via a two-factor authentication (2FA) code to ensure the security of the transaction. When making a withdrawal request, the user must provide the temporary code generated by an authenticator app, such as Google Authenticator or Authy, to validate the transaction. This process adds an extra layer of protection, preventing unauthorized withdrawals and ensuring that only authenticated users can complete withdrawal transactions.

### Authorization

Bearer token allows requests to be authenticated using an access key, such as a JSON Web Token (JWT). The token is a text string included in the request header.

```
Bearer <Your API token>
```
