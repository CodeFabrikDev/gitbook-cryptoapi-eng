# \[POST] /2fa/verify

The \[POST]/2fa/verify method checks the validity of a TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password) authentication code provided by the user, as part of the two-factor authentication (2FA) process. On receiving the temporary code generated by an authenticator application (e.g. Google Authenticator or Authy), the method confirms that the code is correct and within the validity time. This verification adds an extra layer of security to the login process, ensuring that only users with access to the authenticating device can complete the login and access the account.

### Authorization

```

```
